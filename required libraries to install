note that after installing white noise and adding it in middleware and setting the  default media folders, you are suppposed to first run python manage.py collectstatic, before doing it's configuration in wsgi.py. otherwise, the static folder will still be empty and the files which require static files being served like the admin page will break

note: for all of these, if it's a new project, you will have to follow all the steps required to make them work. ie whether to include 
them in installed_apps or something like that.
